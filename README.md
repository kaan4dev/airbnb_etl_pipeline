# Airbnb ETL Pipeline with PySpark, BigQuery & Airflow

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end ETL (Extract â€“ Transform â€“ Load) pipeline** built on the **Airbnb dataset**.  
The pipeline extracts raw data, cleans and transforms it with PySpark, loads the results into Google BigQuery, and enables rich SQL analysis.  
Finally, the workflow is orchestrated with Apache Airflow.

## Data Analysis

Sample SQL queries for analysis in BigQuery:

```sql
-- Total number of rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `airbnb_pipeline.cleaned_listings`;

-- Average price by room type
SELECT room_type, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM `airbnb_pipeline.cleaned_listings`
GROUP BY room_type
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;
```

For advanced queries and visualizations, see [notebooks/analysis.ipynb](notebooks/analysis.ipynb).

##  Airflow DAG

The ETL pipeline can be orchestrated via Apache Airflow.
DAG file: `dags/airbnb_etl_dag.py`

Run Airflow locally:

```bash
airflow standalone
```

## Key Outcomes

With this project, i:

* Built a full ETL pipeline from raw Airbnb data to analytics,
* Performed large-scale data cleaning and feature engineering with PySpark,
* Integrated with Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery,
* Automated the workflow using Airflow,
* Conducted SQL analysis and visualization in Jupyter Notebook.
